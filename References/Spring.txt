Spring Framework
- Creating objects of our classes
  - There are different ways of achieving this in Spring:
    Option 1
    --------
    We need to write an xml file in which we will do the entry of the class 
    whose object has to be created
    - for ex, if we have class:
      class HelloWorld {
        ..
      }
      Then in the xml file, we need to write this:
      <bean id="hello" class="com.ey.component.HelloWorld" />
    
    Option 2
    --------
    We will use annotations provided by Spring in our class:
    @Component("hello")
    class HelloWorld {
        ..
    }
    To make this code work, we need to do the following entry in the xml file:
    <context:component-scan base-package="com.ey.component" />
    
    Option 3
    --------
    In recent projects, we are not using xml approach for configuration
    xml based configuration has been replaced with java based configuration
    @Configuration
	@ComponentScan("com.ey.component") //equivalent to <context:component-scan .. />
	public class MySpringConfig {

		//@Bean -- this is equivalent to <bean tag of xml />
	}
	
- And managing the dependencies between objects
  - We use @Autowired annotation to inject dependendies in our code:
    TODO: What are the different ways of inject object in a class
  
This core feature of Spring is called as DI

Apart from DI, there are many project specific requirements for which we use Spring
- To start with we will now introduce Spring's Database integration support


Java Bean
- Any class in Java can be referred to as bean in modern terms
- Traditionally for a Java code to be given the title of JavaBean, it has to follow these rules:
  - It should have a default constructor
  - It should have getters/setters
  - It should implements Serializable interface
  
- There's one alternative term used instead of Javabean commonly:
	- POJO
