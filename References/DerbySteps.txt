Download and Extract Derby Database

From the bin folder, launch startNetworkserver.bat to start the DB Engine

Then from the bin folder, launch ij.bat to interact with the DB

Type the following command in ij:

connect 'jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/training;create=true;user=root;password=root';

This will create a database which we can connect to easily from our java code as well
